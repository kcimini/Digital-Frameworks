# Are boys or girls most likely to die in a school shooting? 

Media reports often cite bullying and anger at girls who wouldn’t date them as the “reasons” school shooters have for committing mass murder. In the mid-May Santa Fe shooting, for example, many media outlets reported that the shooter chose to begin his rampage in the art class of a girl who he was reported to have either [harassed repeatedly for a date](http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-texas-shooter-20180519-story.html) or [recently broken up with](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/us/school-shooting-santa-fe-texas.html); reports vary by outlet.  

In Parkland, Florida, the shooter chose Valentine’s Day to murder 17 fellow students; reports noted he was [abusive to his ex-girlfriend](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/broward/article200735914.html_ and had fought multiple times with her new boyfriend after they began a relationship, even sending him photos of guns via text.

A pattern has emerged with regards to domestic violence and mass shootings: Domestic violence is arguably a cause of more than [50 percent of all mass shootings](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44126.pdf), which, statistically, is most frequently towards women and romantic partners. 

"Generally, it fits a pattern of easy access to firearms of individuals who have very controlling kind of relationships with their intimate partners and are greatly threatened when their control is challenged," said Daniel Webster, Director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research in a [2017 NPR interview](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/11/07/562387350/in-texas-and-beyond-mass-shootings-have-roots-in-domestic-violence).

But once the shooters get a gun in their hands, do they direct their anger at women and girls, or are they equally dangerous to people of any gender?

In order to answer this question I examined media reports of school shootings and mass school shootings over the last school year (2017-2017) based off media reports. As such, gender of those dead or injured is classified only as male or female, as those were the only genders given publicly by outlets. For those injured but not identified by name or gender, I classified as “U,” or unidentified.

The complete data set [can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JIQNL6l1i15_ELcfjlZcXdId9FOZqoXIEJqkSaB9OXQ/edit?usp=sharing), while [here readers can peruse individual data sets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r-OBCzqhbJuqrnQo6pjXZZARLNpo4XxPmrwjjgmEfz0/edit?usp=sharing) that look at only one specific question.

In order to classify school shooting, given that I was looking strictly for victims of planned shootings, I needed to set some parameters. I chose intent (i.e. the gun did not discharge accidentally), as well as a connection to the school that meant the strong chance others at the school could witness or be injured / killed in said shooting. 

Under these guidelines, a man who murders his ex-wife during school hours in the school where she worked classifies as a school shooting. However, a boyfriend and girlfriend who pulled over into a school parking lot at 2 am to have an argument, resulting in the girlfriend shooting her boyfriend in the leg, does not.

While both these very real examples should be classified as domestic violence, only one can also be classified as a school shooting. Through this examination, it also became clear that there were two types of school shootings: a mass shooting, and a small-group shooting (which typically resulted in only one or two targeted deaths).

In order to compare whether one particular gender was targeted in different I began by looking at mass shootings.

![Deaths, Injuries by Gender for Mass School Shootings, 2017-18](https://github.com/kcimini/Digital-Frameworks/blob/master/chart%20(7).png)

Only three mass shootings took place at schools during the 2017-2018 school year: Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida; Santa Fe High School in Santa Fe, Texas; and Marshall County High School in Benton, Kentucky. 

In examining death and injury reports from these particular shootings, it becomes clear that indeed, women and girls are more targeted than men and boys by school shooters intent on killing and injuring. Women and girls die at almost 1.2 times the rate of their fellow students and teachers, and are more likely to be injured as well, at about the same rate (1.11).

While higher death and injury rate to women and girls in mass school shootings may have something to do with the connection to domestic violence, it is notable that women significantly outnumber men in the teaching profession, making up [77 percent](https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2017/08/15/the-nations-teaching-force-is-still-mostly.html) of the teaching population, and thus are more likely to be present at a school shooting. 

This data, however, must be approached with caution; the number of wounded whose identities and genders were not released to the public is twice that of wounded males and females, and could significantly skew the data one way or another.

Mass shootings, however, are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to school shootings. 

![Deaths, Injuries Per School Shooting, 2017-18](https://github.com/kcimini/Digital-Frameworks/blob/master/chart%20(3).png)

Although they garner the most attention and media coverage, they only make up 6.5 percent of all school shootings throughout the school year. So when their focus is off women and girls, who are school shooters most likely to target? 

Unsurprisingly, it seems their focus turns to men and boys. 

With these guidelines in place, we see that the majority of school shootings result in only one or two deaths or injuries. In many instances the shooter managed to get off only a few shots -- most wildly missing the mark -- before fleeing the scene or being disarmed by a nearby adult. 

In contrast to the targets of mass shootings, men and boys tend to be targeted in these scaled-down school shootings; 58 percent of men and boys who died in school shootings were killed in this fashion. Most of these incidents were the product of arguments between two students that escalated the situation until a gun was drawn.

School shootings, however, are difficult to examine without discussing suicide.

Men and boys tend to favor suicide by gun more than women and girls, and this data set was no exception. Of the eight suicides committed by gun on school grounds, only two were committed by women or girls; the rest were done by male students or teachers.

![School Shooting Injuries, Deaths (Including Suicides) by Gender, 2017-2018](https://github.com/kcimini/Digital-Frameworks/blob/master/chart%20(6).png)

Suicides presented a particularly tricky problem when looking at overall deaths. They comprise a full sixteen percent of school shootings, and therefore skew the data towards male death. While the majority of people who commit suicide are only intent on harming themselves, on occasion school shooters take their own lives after killing others.

A caveat does spring up when looking at suicides, however. In several cases of students committing suicide it was later found that they had planned mass shootings, in some cases even bringing multiple guns, rounds of ammunition and incendiary devices to school, but for one reason or another, decided to only commit suicide instead.

As such, I counted school shootings twice -- once with incidents of suicide and once without, to show how the data presented in both scenarios. Removing all shootings that ended in suicide –– including the other injuries and deaths that resulted from said shootings –– the numbers still show that school shooters who are not bent on mass murder tend to wound and kill men and boys.

All in all, it is probable that while men and boys might be targeted in small-group shootings, girls and women are most focused on by mass shooters, who, [a 2013 congressional research report](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44126.pdf) notes are typically committed by “‘a mentally disordered individual’ whose problems have increased to the point that he acts out against groups of people who are unrelated to him or his problems.”

This conclusion, however, must be treated with caution, given the large number of those unidentified by either name or gender who were wounded in school shootings during the time period this data set was collected.
