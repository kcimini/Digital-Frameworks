![Fatal Car Crashes in Washington, D.C., 2016-17](https://github.com/kcimini/Digital-Frameworks/blob/master/chart%20(1).png)

This chart was made with data from DC's open source data set, opensource.dc.gov, and shows the number of fatal car crashes in Washington, D.C. from 2016-2017, whether they were fatal for the motorist, or pedestrians or bicyclists caught in the crash. 

An interesting point about the pedestrian deaths not shown on the above graph is that in one instance, a 26-car pileup resulted in only one pedestrian death; there were no crashes that resulted in multiple pedestrian, cyclist or motorist fatalities. Indeed, no accidents included in the report mentioned multiple fatalities. This is shocking as there were nearly 20 thousand car crashes in the time period I reported on; that fewer than 50 people died as a result of traffic accidents shows that D.C. is actually a very safe city for traveling around, and its traffic laws -- particularly the strong enforcement of pedestrian right-of-way in crosswalks -- seems to work. 

If given more time to explore this dataset, I'd like to compare car crash dates and times to instances when the D.C. metro was down, to see if there is an uptick in crashes, fatalities, or both. It would also be interesting to compare D.C.'s car crash deaths to those in a city of a similar size with a metro, as while 50 fatalities may seem low, this is only one data point in a much larger picture.
