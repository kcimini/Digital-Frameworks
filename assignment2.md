*Question: Where are the greatest gender pay gaps by county?*

While we know that, on average, white women earn 80 cents to the dollar per white man, black women earn 67.7, Hispanic women earn 62 and Asian women earn 93, per the [Institute for Women’s Policy Research](https://iwpr.org/publications/gender-wage-gap-2017-race-ethnicity/), I’m curious to know if this gap is exacerbated in certain areas, and what the spread is. Looking at the data there, and the data of voters, I think we could also begin to discern whether constituents – particularly women constituents – are voting against their own self-interests, or whether they are speaking out for them. 

Would a wage gap, for example, be more prevalent in areas that proscribe conservative values and tend to vote Republican, which often have weaker pay equality laws? Instead, is it more likely to happen in cities, traditionally bastions of blue voters, as poorer people tend to cluster there and may be more easily taken advantage of? 

The [data set](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/community_facts.xhtml#) I found that can address this issue comes from the U.S. Census Bureau, titled the 2012-2016 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates. 

It can be searched by zip code, county, town, or state, and while the U.S. census does have issues, mis- or undercounting recent immigrants, homeless people or groups that are otherwise distrustful of community outsiders, it is also the most complete data set we have about the American people. Using the original data will also give us more control over how we search, what factors we take into account, and prevent errors from an outside source.  

Once that is collated and plotted out, we can access voter file data by state, and sort for women voters only. The data could be accessed through organizations like Nation Builder, but it would be better to get it directly from the states so we have access to all the raw data we’d like, and there are no third-party errors in the data.
