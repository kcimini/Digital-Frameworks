I sorted the data to find how many times congressional campaigns had made payments to Trump Hotels, Trump International Hotels, or Trump-owned golf courses. The emoluments clause ostensibly prevents President Trump from profiting personally off his businesses while in office in order to prevent people from purchasing influence. That, however, doesn't quite seem to be the case with this president. I wanted to find out if the data supported that -- are the candidates who are spending money at Trump's businesses receiving rewards such as time with the President, support, or some other form of favor? 

According to the data, there were 54 payments made to Trump businesses in 2018 by more than 30 congressional campaigns. Not all these payments were large -- indeed, there's one for just $6.69 for a meeting fee -- and many were in the low thousands, for staff rooms and meals. There were a few, however, that rang in a little higher, and one bill paid by Bill Shuster for Congress that came in just under $20,000.

Are these would-be congresspeople paying to play? 

While "influence" in and of itself is difficult to parse, one way to tell would be to (once the midterms take place) compare the list of congressional campaigns that spent at Trump-owned businesses to those who won their elections. 

Since this has not happened yet, however, we would need to go about this "influence check" another way. Here, we could look at where the 30-plus congressional hopefuls are from, and how much time Trump and his supporters have dedicated to propping up their campaigns. Did Trump, for example, stump for them, or did he ask his supporters in congress to do so? Are any of his former staffers working for them? 

In this instance, knowledge of timing is critical; if the payments to Trump businesses are scattered before and after Trump supported or endorsed said candidates (if that indeed did happen), it is likely a coincidence. However, if they appear in a pattern (all or majority before Trump assistance, or after) then it is likely there is a correlation between earning the president's good will and support and supplementing his family's coffers.
