# "The Fight Over Teacher Salaries: A Look At The Numbers"

[NPR's Education blog ](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2018/03/16/592221378/the-fight-over-teacher-salaries-a-look-at-the-numbers) covered teacher salaries and put teacher strikes into strong perspective, contrasting teacher salaries by state with salaries adjusted for cost-of-living. 

"The Fight Over Teacher Salaries: A Look At The Numbers" took an ongoing story of teacher strikes which began in in West Virginia, and spread to Oklahoma, Arizona, Kentucky, and possibly others. The data set itself is very clear and easy to understand, and while it is similar to the Axios story you displayed in class, the chart is easier for me, personally, to read, because they all have the same x-axis. 

The authors did link to the data, which was pulled from the National Center for Education Statistics (for teacher salaries) and the Council for Community and Economic Research (for cost-of-living per state). They also credited the source that pulled the data together for NPR as well, making this as transparent as possible. 

I thought the reporting was clear and concise, and the table lent an interesting angle to the information; it gave me the opportunity to chew it over myself and draw my own conclusions. I could look only at states that ended in a "K" or contrast different regions or states within defined regions. I am still curious, however, about how teacher benefits weight salaries as well, and how that impacts teachers' attitudes towards higher or lower salaries. 

## Things I would like to see included:
* hard numbers on benefits (healthcare, retirement, etc) and how they stack up across the nation
* how they stack up within the state -- are they high, low, etc
* average age of retirement
* what other professions in the state make a salary in this range
